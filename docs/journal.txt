CREATE WALLET FUNCTION:

- createWalletForCustomer(customerId)

input : customerId

output : public key and private key and customerId

Save it encripted in a file with customer in json format, to reused the wallet and user in other fucntion or not encrypted   ?

lets keep it simple for now, and we can add more features later

now create a funcion to save new wallet with user or create a new wallet every time?

keep it simple for now, and we can add more features later

=======================================================================================================================================

DEVNET AIRDROP FUNCTION:

- airdrop_sol_devnet(publicKey)
or
- airdrop_basic(publicKey)

input : public key

output : success or error and balance?

doubts can be an airdrop function for each network?, what we want here is airdrop of solana in devnet.

lets do simple devnet_airdrop_solana function

now we can see how save the wallet and user in a file and reuse it in other functions, to make it simple just we can save it in the json file and user can copy paste.


we try to ask user for customerId , but there is the punycode problem error jjthat don't leet see really the questions for the customerId input, so we can fix the issue by downgrading node
or just give extra espaces make make it more clear the question.


issue: 
console.log after node src/index.js
